Our goal is to make a cute and romantic website to ask someone out. Get as creative as you can !!

Welcome to the Romantic Website project! This is a simple webpage created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The webpage features a romantic theme with interactive elements like a flipping card, raining heart emojis, and more.
