Our goal is to make such a website. Get as creative as you can !!

Welcome to the Romantic Website project! This is a simple webpage created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The webpage features a romantic theme with interactive elements like a flipping card, raining heart emojis, and more.

## Features

1. **Flipping Card**: The main content is presented on a flipping card, with a romantic message on the front and a special question on the back.

2. **Interactive Buttons**: Clicking the "Yes" button triggers a delightful response. The "No" button has a unique hover effect where it relocates randomly but is not clickable.

3. **Hypnosis Animation**: On the back of the card, there's a hypnotic animation suggesting a positive response.

4. **Heart Emoji Rain**: Pink heart emojis rain down across the entire page, adding a romantic touch.
